## Important info regarding COVID-19

- [STAY HOME IF YOU ARE FEELING ILL](https://ehs.utoronto.ca/covid-19-information/proceduresucheck-confirmedcase-symptoms-illness/)
  - this is absolutely vital for everyone's health and safety
  - complete a [UCheck self-assessment](https://www.utoronto.ca/utogether/ucheck)
  - contact your local public health provider for care & testing
  - if you test positive contact ehs.occhealth@utoronto.ca to initiate contact tracing
  - you will not be penalized for missing classes or labs or exams - email the instructors and we will  get you the information you need to succeed
- [Do not come to class if you are not vaccinated (1st dose by Sep 13, 2nd dose by Oct 15) or exempt](https://www.utoronto.ca/utogether/vaccines)
  - if you are in the process of becoming fully vaccinated or exempt [you must regularly screen for COVID-19 (e.g., before Monday's class every week)](https://www.utoronto.ca/utogether/rapid-screening)
- Complete a [UCheck self-assessment](https://www.utoronto.ca/utogether/ucheck) before arriving to class each day
- [Where a mask at all times in class (exemptions apply)](https://www.provost.utoronto.ca/planning-policy/joint-provostial-and-human-resources-guideline-on-facemasks-at-the-university-of-toronto/)
- Wash your hands regularly (with soap or sanitizer) and avoid touching your face
- Practice physical distancing

## Learning objectives
Mathematics is central to science because it provides a rigourous way to go from a set of assumptions (what we take to be true) to their logical consequences (what we want to know). In ecology & evolution this might be how we think SARS-Cov-2 may spread and evolve given a set of vaccination rates and travel restrictions, how caribou population sizes are predicted to respond to forecasted rates of climate change, or something much more abstract like the amount of genetic diversity in a randomly mating population. In this class we'll learn how to build, analyze, and interpret mathematical models of increasing complexity through lectures, readings, homeworks, computer labs, and a final project. By the end of the class you will be able to:
- build a model: go from a verbal description of a biological system to a set of equations
- analyze a model: manipulate a set of equations into a mathematical expression of interest
- interpret a model: translate mathematical expressions back into biological meaning

## Instructors

### Professor
Dr. Matthew Osmond (he/him)
- email: mm.osmond@utoronto.ca
- office hours: Wednesday 11-12, Earth Sciences Centre (ESC) 3041
- website: [osmond-lab.github.io](https://osmond-lab.github.io/)

### Teaching assistant (TA)
Puneeth Deraje

## Course format
This course follows a "flipped class" style, meaning you'll watch lectures asynchronously online so that we can use the class time to actively work on problem sets together.

### Weekly tasks:
- watch two lectures online (asynchronous) [approx. time = 1h]
- read two assigned sections of the text (one for each lecture) [approx. time = 2h]
- attend two classes (includes time to work on the "home"work assignment) [approx. time = 2h]
- submit "home"work assignment (ideally completed during class time) [approx. time = 0h]
- attend computer lab (lab assignment due at the end of the lab) [approx. time = 2h]

### When and where
- **lectures**: asynchronous, Quercus
- **classes**: Monday 10-11am & Wednesday 10-11am, Ramsay Wright (RW) 142
- **lab**: Wednesday 3-5pm, []

### Grading scheme
- 20% - "home"work assignments (12)
