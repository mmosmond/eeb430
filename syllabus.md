# EEB 430/1430 - Mathematical modeling in ecology & evolution

## Important info regarding COVID-19
- the first two weeks of class will be **entirely** online
- starting September 27th we may hold **optional** in-person tutorials during class times
  - these will be recorded for those not comfortable with attending in person
- for the (optional) in-person meetings:
  - [STAY HOME IF YOU ARE FEELING ILL](https://ehs.utoronto.ca/covid-19-information/proceduresucheck-confirmedcase-symptoms-illness/)
    - this is absolutely vital for everyone's health and safety
    - you *will not* be penalized for missing classes or labs or exams - email the instructors and we will  get you the information you need to succeed
    - you should still complete a [UCheck self-assessment](https://www.utoronto.ca/utogether/ucheck)
    - contact your local public health provider for care & testing
    - if you test positive contact ehs.occhealth@utoronto.ca to initiate contact tracing
  - [Do not come to campus if you are not vaccinated (1st dose by Sep 13, 2nd dose by Oct 15) or exempt](https://www.utoronto.ca/utogether/vaccines)
    - if you are exempt or in the process of becoming fully vaccinated [you must regularly screen for COVID-19 (e.g., before Monday's class every week)](https://www.utoronto.ca/utogether/rapid-screening)
    - if you are fully vaccinated you can still get a free rapid test kit and test yourself regularly to help limit spread
  - Complete a [UCheck self-assessment](https://www.utoronto.ca/utogether/ucheck) before arriving on campus each day
  - [Where a mask at all times indoors (if you have an exemption, please provide a letter from Accessibility Services)](https://www.provost.utoronto.ca/planning-policy/joint-provostial-and-human-resources-guideline-on-facemasks-at-the-university-of-toronto/)
  - Wash your hands regularly (with soap or sanitizer) and avoid touching your face
  - Practice physical distancing when possible (2 meter spacing)

## Land acknowledgement
We wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates. For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and the Mississaugas of the Credit. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land.

For more information see https://indigenous.utoronto.ca/about/land-acknowledgement/.

## Group norms
The University of Toronto is committed to equity, human rights and respect for diversity. All members of the learning environment in this course should strive to create an
atmosphere of mutual respect where all members of our community can express themselves, engage with each other, and respect one another’s differences. U of T does
not condone discrimination or harassment against any persons or communities. For more information see:
- [Code of Student Conduct](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/secretariat/policies/code-student-conduct-december-13-2019)
- [Netiquette]( https://learn.canvas.net/courses/1340/pages/netiquette-the-golden-rules-for-online-courses)

## Learning objectives
Mathematics is central to science because it provides a rigorous way to go from a set of assumptions (what we take to be true) to their logical consequences (what we want to know). In ecology & evolution this might be how we think SARS-CoV-2 may spread and evolve given a set of vaccination rates and travel restrictions, how caribou population sizes are predicted to respond to forecasted rates of climate change, or something much more abstract like the amount of genetic diversity in a randomly mating population. In this class we'll learn how to build, analyze, and interpret mathematical models of increasing complexity through lectures, readings, homeworks, computer labs, and a final project. By the end of the class you will be able to:
- build a model: go from a verbal description of a biological system to a set of equations
- analyze a model: manipulate a set of equations into a mathematical expression of interest
- interpret a model: translate mathematical expressions back into biological meaning

## Course format
This course follows a "flipped class" style, meaning you'll watch lectures asynchronously online so that we can use the class time to actively work on problem sets together.

### Weekly tasks:
- watch two lectures online (asynchronous) [approx. time = 1h]
- read two assigned sections of the text (one for each lecture) [approx. time = 2h]
- attend two, optionally in-person, classes (includes time to work on the "home"work assignment) [approx. time = 2h]
- submit "home"work assignment (ideally completed during class time) [approx. time = 0h]
- attend online (synchronous) computer lab (lab assignment due at the end of the lab) [approx. time = 2h]

### When and where
- **lectures**: asynchronous, Quercus
- **classes**: Monday 10-11am & Wednesday 10-11am, Ramsay Wright (RW) 142 (recordings will be posted on Quercus)
- **lab**: Wednesday 3-5pm, Zoom

### Course webpage
All course information will be posted on [Quercus](https://q.utoronto.ca) or emailed to you directly through your utoronto email. If you have any problem accessing the material, let us know right away via email so we can fix the problem.
