## Land acknowledgement
We wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates. For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and the Mississaugas of the Credit. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land.

## Accessibility
The University provides academic accommodations for students with disabilities in accordance with the terms of the [Ontario Human Rights Code](http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/ontario-human-rights-code). This occurs through a collaborative process that acknowledges a collective obligation to develop an accessible learning environment that both meets the needs of students and preserves the essential academic requirements of the University’s courses and programs.

Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. If you have a disability that may require accommodations, please feel free to email the instructors and/or the [Accessibility Services office](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/department/accessibility-services/).

## Religious observances
The University provides reasonable accommodation of the needs of students who observe religious holy days other than those already accommodated by ordinary scheduling and statutory holidays. Students have a responsibility to alert members of the teaching staff in a timely fashion to upcoming religious observances and anticipated absences and instructors will make every reasonable effort to avoid scheduling tests, examinations or other compulsory activities at these times.

Please reach out to the instructors as early as possible to communicate any anticipated absences related to religious observances, and to discuss any possible related implications for course work.

## Family care responsibilities
The University of Toronto strives to provide a family-friendly environment. You may wish to inform the instructors if you are a student with family responsibilities. If you are a student parent or have family responsibilities, you also may wish to visit the [Family Care Office website](https://familycare.utoronto.ca).

# EEB 430/1430 - Mathematical modeling in ecology & evolution

### Prerequisites
BIO220H1 (eco/evo dynamics), EEB225H1 (biostats), MAT136H1/MAT137Y1 (calculus), MAT223H1 (linear algebra), and at least one of EEB319H1 (population ecology)/EEB321H1 (community ecology)/EEB322H1 (behaviour)/EEB323H1 (evolutionary genetics)

- get in touch with the professor if you have questions about meeting the prerequisites

## Learning objectives
Mathematics is central to science because it provides a rigorous way to go from a set of assumptions (what we take to be true) to their logical consequences (what we want to know). In ecology & evolution this might be how we think SARS-CoV-2 may spread and evolve given a set of vaccination rates and travel restrictions, how caribou population sizes are predicted to respond to forecasted rates of climate change, or something much more abstract like the expected amount of genetic diversity in a randomly mating population. In this course we'll learn how to build, analyze, and interpret mathematical models of increasing complexity through readings, lectures, tutorials, assignments, computer labs, and a final project. By the end of the course you will be able to:

- build a model: go from a verbal description of a biological system to a set of equations
- analyze a model: manipulate a set of equations into a mathematical expression of interest
- interpret a model: translate mathematical expressions back into biological meaning
