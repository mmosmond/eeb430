## Course format
This course follows a "flipped class" style, meaning you'll watch lectures asynchronously online so that we can use the class time to actively work on problem sets together. Two lectures will be posted each week and there will be two 1-hour (synchronous) classes. There is also a weekly 2-hour computer lab. One problem set and one lab will be due each week (ideally completed during the class/lab time). There will also be a midterm and final exam, as well as a final project.

## When and where
Lectures: asynchronous, Quercus
Classes/tutorials: Tues 10-11am & Thurs 10-11am, [WHERE]
Labs: Thurs 3-5pm, [WHERE]
