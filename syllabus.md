## Course format
This course follows a "flipped class" style, meaning you'll watch lectures asynchronously online so that we can use the class time to actively work on problem sets together.

### Weekly tasks:
- watch two lectures online (1 for each class)
- read two assigned sections of the text (1 for each class)
- attend two classes (where we'll work on the "home"work assignments)
- submit "home"work assignment (ideally completed during class time)
- attend computer lab (and submit lab assignment, due at the end of the lab)

There will also be a midterm and final exam, as well as a final project.

### When and where
Lectures: asynchronous, Quercus\
Classes: Tues 10-11am & Thurs 10-11am, [WHERE]\
Labs: Thurs 3-5pm, [WHERE]
