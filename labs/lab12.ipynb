    "Now imagine that $p(t+1)$ does not give the frequency in the next generation. Instead, imagine all $N$ individuals in the population producing a very large number of gametes, in proportion to their fitness, from which $N$ are chosen at random to make the next generation. Then $p(t+1)$ is the fraction of that large number of gametes with allele A. Sampling $N$ of these gametes, the probability we sample $X(t+1)=j$ with allele A given there were $X(t)=i$ with allele A in the previous generation (i.e., $p(t)=i/N$) is then given by a **binomial distribution**\n",
