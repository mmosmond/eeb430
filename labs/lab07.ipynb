    "This model assumes that the density of prey, $N$, grows logistically in the absence of predators, with per capita growth rate $r$ and carrying capacity $K$. Predators, with density $P$, consume prey at a per prey per predator rate of $a/(1+b N)$. This is because, while increasing prey density will increase the rate at which predators catch prey, consuming prey takes time, and so there is an upper limit in the rate at which a predator can consume prey. Finally, we assume each consumed prey is converted into a fraction $c$ new predators, and that predators die at per capita rate $d$. Putting all this together in a continuous-time model we have\n",
