## Acknowledgements
HUGE thanks to [Leithen M'Gonigle](https://www.sfu.ca/biology/faculty/M'Gonigle/index.html) for much of this material. I think Leithen based much of his population dynamics course off of [Sally Otto's](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~otto/) biomath course, which is based on the fantastic text by Otto & Day, [A Biologist's Guide to Mathematical Modeling in Ecology and Evolution](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/biomath/).
