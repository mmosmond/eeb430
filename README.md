Computer labs for EEB 430/1430 (Mathematical modeling in ecology and evolution) at the University of Toronto

## Running the labs 
To run the labs from your browser in a pre-built environment -- no installation required -- click on the binder tab below:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mmosmond/eeb430/main?filepath=labs)

Alternatively, you can download the labs and upload them to [cocalc.com](https://cocalc.com/).

Or you can [install SageMath locally](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/), download the labs, and run with ```sage -n jupyterlab```.

## Acknowledgements
Huge thanks to [Leithen M'Gonigle](https://www.sfu.ca/biology/faculty/M'Gonigle/index.html) for sharing his Maxima labs with me, some of which I've translated from Maxima into SageMath. Leithen's population dynamics course is based off of [Sally Otto's](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~otto/) biomath course, which is based off of the fantastic text by Otto & Day, [A Biologist's Guide to Mathematical Modeling in Ecology and Evolution](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/biomath/), which this course also follows.
