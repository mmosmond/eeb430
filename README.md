## Acknowledgements
HUGE thanks to [Leithen M'Gonigle](https://www.sfu.ca/biology/faculty/M'Gonigle/index.html) for much of this material, which I've customized and reorgranized for my own purposes (eg, translating his Maxima labs into SageMath). Leithen's population dynamics course is based off of [Sally Otto's](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~otto/) biomath course, which is based off of the fantastic text by Otto & Day, [A Biologist's Guide to Mathematical Modeling in Ecology and Evolution](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/biomath/).
